; the way the ahk compiler works is that it stops executing code after it encounters a
; label declaration or hotkey capture. As some files can have labels in them when they 
; are included, the code in the next files is no longer executed - although most files 
; contain function declarations, some also contain variable initialization and this will 
; not happen anymore
